            <h4>Here's a timeline of Yi Sun-Shin's event and milestones:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>He was born April 28th, 1545</li>
                <li>When he was young Yi played war games with the other boys and he showed good leadership at a young
                    age. He even made his own bow and arrows as a young teen. </li>
                <li>Yi became proficient at reading and writing Chinese. In 1576 Yi signed up with the army and passed
                    with flying colors. It is said that the judges were impressed with his swordsmanship and archery.
                </li>
                <li>He failed the cavalry part because he broke his leg but after it healed tried again and passed that
                    part. When Yi was sent out to his regiment, he quickly became known for his strategy skills and
                    leadership.</li>

                <li>He was a Korean naval commander who was famous because of all the battles he fought, he never lost
                    one. He fought in at least 23 battles.</li>
                <li>He always had fewer men and less vessels than his opponent but still won.</li>
                <li>Yi won the battle of Myeongnyang which was his greatest achievement. He only had 13 ships while the
                    Japanese had 333 ships. This was one of the greatest victories in naval history.</li>
                <li>Yi also became famous because he brought back the turtle ship to fight the Japanese. This was a
                    great
                    battle ship because it was fast and had spikes all around it and a roof so it was very hard for
                    enemies
                    to board the ship. Each Turtle Ship held 11 cannons on each side of the ship, two on the bow and two
                    on
                    the stern. The figure head, which was a dragon, held four. These ships were very effective in
                    helping
                    Admiral Yi defeat the Japanese.</li>
                <li>Yi died at the battle of Noryang on December 16th 1598.</li>
                <li>In Busan, South Korea there is now a statue of Yi</li>
                <li>Today Admiral Yi is thought of as one of the greatest heroes and admirals of all Korean history. He
                    is regarded as a great man because of his courage, intellect, loyalty and strength.</li>
            </ul>
